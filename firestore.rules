/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for AuthZen application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, ensuring that users can only
 * access their own data. All data is nested under /users/{userId}, providing
 * a clear and secure data hierarchy.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/dashboards/{dashboardId}: Stores dashboards owned by the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own user document and their dashboards.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - Read-only collections are not applicable in this data model.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Dashboard` entity contains a `userId` field, denormalizing the ownership
 *   relationship. This allows for efficient authorization checks without needing
 *   to perform additional reads.
