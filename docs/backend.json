    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to securely manage user data and dashboards. The `/users/{userId}` collection stores user profiles, while the `/users/{userId}/dashboards/{dashboardId}` subcollection stores dashboards owned by each user. This structure uses path-based ownership, ensuring strong data isolation and simplified security rules. Authorization Independence is achieved because access control is directly tied to the path and the user's authentication status. List operations are secure due to the hierarchical structure; a user can only list dashboards within their own user document. Because of this data segregation and strict user ownership, QAPs are directly supported by the path structure."
